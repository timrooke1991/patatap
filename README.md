# patatap

This is a simple app to understand more around how JavaScript libraries work and fit into an application. The site is a basic clone of Patatap. The project uses two JavaScript libraries: Paper.js and Howler.js. Aside from the libraries, this project also allowed me to get more familiar with keypress events.

The site plays audio sounds when a letter on the keyboard is hit. Each sound corresponds to a particular key. This is facilitated by the howler.js library. When a letter is hit, an animation is also visualised, which is enabled by the paper.js library. The animation is a simple, shrinking circle - each letter key has its own corresponding colour. 

The main benefit for me of this project was understanding more about animation and audio and how this can be used in web applications. Also, it was useful to get familiar with some basic JavaScript libraries and understand how to incorporate external code from libraries into my own sites and applications.
